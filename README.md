# DevSecOps with Docker Scout: Hotstar Clone

Welcome to the DevSecOps project that utilizes Docker Scout to create a clone of Hotstar, a popular video streaming platform. This project is designed to demonstrate the integration of security practices within the DevOps lifecycle, using Docker for containerization and Docker Scout for security scanning.

## Introduction

This project aims to build a secure and scalable video streaming platform similar to Hotstar, using DevSecOps principles. DevSecOps is a culture and practice of integrating security into the DevOps lifecycle, ensuring that security is not an afterthought but a part of the development process from the start.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker (version 19.03.8 or higher)
- Docker Compose (version 1.25.0 or higher)
- Docker Scout (installation instructions can be found on the official Docker Scout website)

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotstar-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd hotstar-clone
   ```

3. Build the Docker images:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. Start the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start streaming videos. The application is designed to simulate the functionality of Hotstar, including video playback, user authentication, and content management.

## DevSecOps Practices

This project incorporates the following DevSecOps practices:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Code is scanned for vulnerabilities during the build phase.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: The running application is scanned for vulnerabilities.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Security is integrated into the infrastructure setup using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated pipelines ensure that security checks are part of the deployment process.
- **Security Configuration Management**: Ensuring that all containers and services are configured securely.

## Docker Scout Integration

Docker Scout is used to scan Docker images for security vulnerabilities. To run a security scan with Docker Scout, use the following command:

```
docker scout scan
```

This will analyze the Docker images used in the project and report any potential security issues.
